1 - Jenkins- continuous integration - open source
circle CI
Bamboo
Gitlab
Travis CI
Teamcity
codeShip


2 Plan , code, Build , test,deploy , operate, and monitor
3* - Jenkins default port number - 8080.
4*- Jenkins is purly working with plugins.
5 - install java by using cmd
 yum install fontconfig java-11-openjdk

10 - Jenkins - before Jenkins install we need install some packages which are in Jenkins.io
yum install Jenkins

11 - connect to Jenkins dashboard - user id - jenkinsadmin, pw -admin123
public ip:8080
 2 types of troubleshoot when Jenkins dashboard is not loading

free style job - jobname- 
plugins - manage Jenkins - manage plugins

15 - SCM - install - SVn - subversion

16 - Build tool - Maven - pls refer maven notes

17 - Build trigger -  5 types of build triggers 
to run/ configure the jobs automatically 
 A- trigger builds remotely - job access
token name = token1
JENKINS_URL/job/job1/build?token=TOKEN_NAME or /buildWithParameters?token=TOKEN_NAME
http://52.91.86.144:8080/job/job1/build?token=token1

B- build after other project
 - upstream and down stream jobs in Jenkins
up stream - it is configured project that triggers a project as part of its execution
down stream - it is configured project that is triggered as part of a execution of pipeline.

C-. build periodically - to schedule a job automatically
Minute 0-59
Hour 0-23
DOM 1-31
Month 1-12
DOW 0-7
